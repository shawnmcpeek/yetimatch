   - Maximum 1 per session
   - Skippable after 3 seconds

**Forbidden Placements:**

**Ad Networks:**
- Primary: Google AdMob (best fill rates)
- Backup: Unity Ads or AppLovin
- Expected eCPM: $1-3 (varies by region)

- **Premium tier user:** $3.49 one-time

**Breakeven:** 1 Basic tier user = ~200 free users with ads

**$4.99 for Premium:**
- ✅ Still under $5 barrier
- ✅ Premium positioning without being expensive
- ✅ Good profit margin (~$3.49 after fees)
- ✅ $2 upgrade from Basic feels reasonable
- ✅ High enough to signal "extra value"

**Why One-Time vs Subscription:**
- ✅ Users HATE subscriptions for simple apps
- ✅ One-time = better reviews and sentiment

## Notes

**Flexibility:**
This plan should be adjusted based on real user data. The prices, free quiz count, and features are starting points. Be ready to pivot based on:
- Conversion rates
- User feedback
- Competitive landscape
- Revenue goals

**Regional Pricing:**
Consider adjusting prices for different markets:
- US/Canada/Western Europe: Full price
- Latin America/Eastern Europe: 20-30% lower
- India/Southeast Asia: 40-50% lower
(App Store/Play Store handle this automatically with "price tiers")

**Long-term Strategy:**
Once you hit 100+ quizzes and strong user base:
- Consider raising Premium to $5.99-$7.99
- Add more premium features to justify price
- Potentially introduce a "Lifetime" tier at $9.99-$14.99 with all future features
